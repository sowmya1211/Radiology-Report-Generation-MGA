"""
This module contains all functions used to evaluate the language model.

The (main) function evaluate_language_model of this module is called by the function evaluate_model in evaluate_model.py.

evaluate_language_model returns language_model_scores which include:
    - METEOR for:
        - all generated sentences
        - generated sentences for each region
        - generated sentences with gt = normal region (i.e. the region was considered normal by the radiologist)
        - generated sentences with gt = abnormal region (i.e. the region was considered abnormal by the radiologist)

    - BLEU 1-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr-D for all generated reports 
    - Clinical efficacy metrics for all generated reports:
        - micro-averaged over 5 observations
        - exampled-based averaged over all 14 observations
        - computed for each observation individually

It also calls subfunctions which:
    - save NUM_BATCHES_OF_GENERATED_SENTENCES_TO_SAVE_TO_FILE (see run_configurations.py) batches of generated sentences as a txt file
    (for manual verification what the model generates)
    - save NUM_BATCHES_OF_GENERATED_REPORTS_TO_SAVE_TO_FILE (see run_configurations.py) batches of generated reports as a txt file
    (for manual verification what the model generates)
    - save NUM_IMAGES_TO_PLOT (see run_configurations.py) images to tensorboard where gt and predicted bboxes for every region are depicted,
    as well as the generated sentences (if they exist) and reference sentences for every region

    This function computes:
        - micro average CE scores over all 14 conditions
        - micro average CE scores over 5 conditions ("Cardiomegaly", "Edema", "Consolidation", "Atelectasis", "Pleural Effusion")
        -> this is done following Miura (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10042.pdf)
        - (micro) average CE scores of each condition
        - example-based CE scores over all 14 conditions
        -> this is done following Nicolson (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09405.pdf)

    To compute these scores, we first need to get the disease labels extracted by CheXbert for both the generated and reference reports.
    This is done by the (nested) function "get_chexbert_labels_for_gen_and_ref_reports". Inside this function, there is another function
    called "label" from the module src/CheXbert/src/label.py that extracts these labels requiring 2 input arguments:
        1. chexbert (nn.Module): instantiated chexbert model
        2. csv_path (str): path to the csv file with the reports. The csv file has to have 1 column titled "Report Impression"
        under which the reports can be found

    We use a temporary directory to create the csv files for the generated and reference reports.

    The function label returns preds_gen_reports and preds_ref_reports respectively, which are List[List[int]],
    with the outer list always having len=14 (for 14 conditions, specified in CheXbert/src/constants.py),
    and the inner list has len=num_reports.

    E.g. the 1st inner list could be [2, 1, 0, 3], which means the 1st report has label 2 for the 1st condition (which is 'Enlarged Cardiomediastinum'),
    the 2nd report has label 1 for the 1st condition, the 3rd report has label 0 for the 1st condition, the 4th and final report label 3 for the 1st condition.

    There are 4 possible labels:
        0: blank/NaN (i.e. no prediction could be made about a condition, because it was no mentioned in a report)
        1: positive (condition was mentioned as present in a report)
        2: negative (condition was mentioned as not present in a report)
        3: uncertain (condition was mentioned as possibly present in a report)

    To compute the micro average scores (i.e. all the scores except of the example-based scores), we follow the implementation of the paper
    by Miura et. al., who considered the negative and blank/NaN to be one whole negative class, and positive and uncertain to be one whole positive class.
    For reference, see lines 141 and 143 of Miura's implementation: https://github.com/ysmiura/ifcc/blob/master/eval_prf.py#L141,
    where label 3 is converted to label 1, and label 2 is converted to label 0.

    To compute the example-based scores, we follow Nicolson's implementation, who considered blank/NaN, negative and uncertain to be the negative class,
    and only positive to be the positive class. Meaning labels 2 and 3 are converted to label 0.
